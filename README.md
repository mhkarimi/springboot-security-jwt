# springboot-security-jwt

This repository is created as an example for post which was written by Vladimir Stankovic on his blog: [JWT Authentication Tutorial: An example using Spring Boot](http://svlada.com/jwt-token-authentication-with-spring-boot/)
I just forked this project to make some minor changes. For instance add Gson or remove the not necessary features.
